## 🤷 About
🚀 Bridging the gap between front and back, I'm a Frontend Engineer with a twist—over 5 years in the tech industry have honed my skills to closely resemble those of a Full-Stack Developer. Expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, and ReactJS. I excel in crafting responsive, user-centric interfaces, while my passion for UI/UX design is brought to life through Figma and Adobe Creative Suite. With a firm grip on backend technologies like Node.js, Next.js and a prowess in cloud services, I stand at the forefront of open source, best practices, and continuous innovation, always keen to collaborate on transformative digital projects.

🤖 Beyond conventional web development, my enthusiasm extends into AI, engaging in development, integration, and automation with AI agents and large language models. I'm also deeply involved in creating personalized chatbots and have a fervent interest in robotics, demonstrated by my contribution to a [NASA-funded LaSpace Rover project](https://youtu.be/quAcbgUL_YU?si=gFHrTBYksIuOxw7w) at McNeese State University. This amalgamation of front-end expertise, AI, and robotics propels me to solve complex challenges with inventive and meaningful solutions.
